Scaling:

Traditional problem of vertical vs horizontal scaling

Triangle of Decentralization, Security, Scalability (choose two)

Sharding: parallel subledgers, less decentralization

ideally, each shard is seperate blockchain

less security, as 51% attack much easier

nodes need verified id (hard in decentralized)

how to do cross shard transactions?

Fruitchains: split tansactions and conssensus blocks

Uniconsensus: reread
